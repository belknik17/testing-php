The repo contains PHP unit test examples using the  
software SimpleTest (http://www.simpletest.org/).

Installation:

Upload all into a sub-folder on your PHP server space.

Install SimpleTest in the folder named simpletest.

The folder simpletest is not in the repo since we want git to ignore it.

Try out the test files in the root folder in approximately this order:

calculator_test1.php - Runs code against a Calculator class.  Adds 2 numbers. 
Does not incorporate SimpleTest.
 
calculator_test2.php - Demonstrates failed tests against Calculator class. 
Includes 2 purposeful failing tests, 3 parameters when 2 expected, divide by zero.

calculator_test3.php - Demonstrates successful tests against Calculator class.

contact_test1.php - Demonstrates successful tests against a PHP contact form.

contact_test2.php - Demonstrates a failed test against a PHP contact form.  
User did not enter their name.

password_form_test.php - Demonstrates passing tests against a mock login form.

There are also files that run more than one test:

suite.php - Includes several of the test files and runs them at one time

run_all.php - Uses a PHP script to run all files that include the string 'test' 
in the file name in the current folder

View how the files work via a browser then view them internally to see 
how they are put together.
